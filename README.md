# easy-trader-app-wpf

# Overview

This is a WPF app that's supposed to be help stores in trading and account management.

I still have a lot pending on it because I'm testing some new design patterns and engineering with it. 

Looking to move all these into a Sandbox project within the solution. 

I will start listing out the functionalities needed to complete it. 

Stay tuned.
